# File Manager in C++

This is a basic file manager implemented in C++. It allows users to navigate directories, list directory contents, create directories, copy files, move files, and change the current directory.

## Features

- **List Contents (`ls`):** View files and subdirectories in the current directory.
- **Create Directory (`mkdir`):** Create a new directory within the current directory.
- **Copy File (`cp`):** Copy a file from one location to another within the current directory.
- **Move File (`mv`):** Move (rename) a file from one location to another within the current directory.
- **Change Directory (`cd`):** Navigate to a different directory within the current directory or its subdirectories.
- **Exit (`exit`):** Terminate the file manager.

## Usage

1. **List Contents (`ls`):** Displays the contents of the current directory.

2. **Create Directory (`mkdir`):** Creates a new directory. Enter the name of the new directory when prompted.

3. **Copy File (`cp`):** Copies a file. Enter the source and destination file paths when prompted.

4. **Move File (`mv`):** Moves (renames) a file. Enter the source and destination file paths when prompted.

5. **Change Directory (`cd`):** Changes to a different directory. Enter the directory name to navigate to when prompted.

6. **Exit (`exit`):** Exits the file manager.
